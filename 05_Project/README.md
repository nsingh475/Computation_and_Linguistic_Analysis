# Formulating Text-to-SQL as a Question-Answering Task

Text-to-SQL interfaces allow users to interact with the databases without actually knowing any query  language. They provide a platform where at the frontend, a user can type-in their question in natural language (NLQ) and get the output on the screen and at the backend, the system converts the NLQ to SQL to generate the requested output. Recently, formulating  NLP tasks as a Question-Answering task has gained a lot of attention and in my work, I have extended the same approach to the Text-to-SQL task.
