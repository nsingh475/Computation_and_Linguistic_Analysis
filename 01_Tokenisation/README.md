# Sentence Segmentation

I have implemented the task of Sentence Segmentation using two approaches:
- Rule Based: Pragmatic segmenter
- Machine Learning Based: NLTK Punct

Files:
- Input: Input_wiki_10_para_20plus_words.txt (I have only used first 10 paragraphs which has the more than 20 words in it)
- Output: pragmetic_segmenter_output.txt and nltk_segmenter_output.txt

More details on the segmenter and their performance can be found in the SentenceSegmentation.pdf file.
